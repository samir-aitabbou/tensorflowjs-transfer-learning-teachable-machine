<p>It's My First Transfer Learning Application Version Using TensorFlow.Js Live In The Browser. It's About Using The Pre-Chopped Up MobileNet V3 Base Model That Provides Image Feature Vectors Instead Of Classifications. And Than Train A New Prediction Head That Can Recognize Custom Objects From Webcam Imagery. And Finally Use The Resulting Models To Classify Data In Real Time.</p>

<p>
It's Time To Test Out Your Very Own Version Of Teachable Machine! Head To The Live Preview, Enable The Webcam, Gather At Least 30 Samples For Class 1 For Some Object In Your Room, And Then Do The Same For Class 2 For A Different Object, Click Train, And Check The Console Log To See Progress. It Should Train Pretty Fast: Once Trained, Show The Objects To The Camera To Get Live Predictions That Will Be Printed To The Status Text Area On The Web Page Near The Top. If You Are Having Trouble, Check My Completed Working Code To See If You Missed Copying Over Anything
